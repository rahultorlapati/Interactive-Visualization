# Interactive Visualization of our Solar System Using a Web Browser
## Project Description
This project is a 3D visualization of our solar system. The user can pan, tilt, zoom in, and zoom out in any manner they want to. It utilizes many open source web technologies, like WebGL, SAGE2, and HTMLCanvas. Since it is a webapp, anyone with a relatively modern web browser can use it. It serves as a tool for educators, students, and space enthusiasts. These stakeholders can use our tool to learn about the scale and size of our solar system. Like the objectives stated in our proposal, the accessibility of this project allows almost anyone to use it.
